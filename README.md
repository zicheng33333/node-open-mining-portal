### I just try to reborn stratum to work with all need algos. Need contributors!!!
-------
##### Node Open Mining Portal consists from 3 main modules:
* Main module - https://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal
* Stratum Pool - https://github.com/foxer666/node-stratum-pool
* Node Multihashing libraries https://github.com/foxer666/node-multi-hashing

Stratum Pool can be replaced with node-merged-pool (it's made in UNOMP)
Adding new algos threw Node Multihashing libraries.

-------
##### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/zicheng33333/node-open-mining-portal.git pool
cd pool
npm update
node init.js
```
-------
#### Requirements
* Node 8.x.x
* Coin daemon
